## Come Visit The Burren website

### Purpose

The purpose of this website is to provide relevant information for tourists visiting The Burren, Co. Clare, 
possibly as part of The Wild Atlantic Way. The website provides accessible information in the form of text, 
images and external links to restaurants, accommodation and tourist attractions. The places listed are displayed 
on the map (Google Maps API) available on the page. Site visitors can also submit a query via a user form. 

The site is laid out as a single, scrollable page, and is responsive on a variety of devices, both landscape and 
portrait. Each section is accessible via the navigation menu list. 

### **Details**

#### **'Homepage' section**
The 'Home' page header contains a simple navigation menu with brand text and section links. This menu is displayed 
as a drop-down toggle menu with hamburger button in mobile view. 

The navigation menu contains Home, About and Contact links (3-page website). 

The majority of the home page section contains a carousel slideshow, with 4 rotating images and a text overlay 
inviting users to ‘Come Visit The Burren’.  

#### **'About The Burren' section**
The first navigation menu link brings the site visitor to an ‘About The Burren’ section, which contains 
historical and factual details about the region. This section appears directly beneath the carousel slideshow, 
and can also be reached by scrolling down from the top of the home page section.  

#### **'Things To Do' section**
The ‘Things To Do’ section contains 3 inline images with headings. These are animated with a JavaScript fadeBox 
function on initial page load. Animation is visibile when scrolling down for the first time visiting the page 
(reload required to view the animation again). 

Text relating to ‘things to do’ in The Burren accompanies the images. 

#### **'Map' section**
The ‘Maps’ section is comprised of 2 parts – buttons and links, and the map itself. The 3 buttons update from 
displaying text to font awesome icons when in mobile view.  
JavaScript has been used to ensure that interchangeable lists are linked to the buttons and also the map display.

#### **'Climate and Weather' section**
The Climate and Weather section contains text regarding local climate, plus a weather widget, which adds to the 
information-providing feel of the site.

#### **'Contact Us' section**
The contact form uses the EmailJS to send the site visitor’s details and message to a designated, checkable email 
address. A separate javascript script file, sendEmail.js, contains the function required to achieve this (a function 
is also present in the <head> section of the HTML file). 

Once the form is submitted a pop-up box containing a 'success' message is displayed, and the form fields are cleared.

### **Responsivity**
The Burren website is responsive across a number of browsers, devices and orientations. The site is contained on one 
vertical, scrollable page. The navigation links bring the user down the page to the relevant sections. Many of the elements 
are side-by-side in desktop view, but placed on top of each other in mobile view. This provides an intuitive experience for 
the user. The 'Map' section, for example, displays the buttons, list and map, easily visible together vertically on a mobile 
screen. 
The mock-ups below display various sections of the overall website.

### **UX (User Experience)** 

#### **Strategy Plane**
This website could be used as part of a tourism drive for the area, possibly a government funded initiative to bring more 
tourists to the area, and boost the economy. The website could also improve the area’s presence online.  
User needs are met, as inspiring imagery encourages further exploration of the site, which leads to relevant information 
on the region. The site owner’s objectives are also met, as the content and ease of use provide relevant information to site 
visitors. 

#### **Strategy Plane**
The website contains a variety of features that enhance the tourism aspect of the site. The carousel slideshow provides 
auto-changing imagery. Three images above the ‘Things To Do’ section fade in as the user’s scroll down, encouraging them to 
take more notice of the imagery and leading down to the descriptive text beneath. 
Three buttons are present that when pressed display lists (links) and related markers on the accompanying map for each topic 
(i.e. Restaurants, Accommodation, Attractions). 
A weather widget is present, which displays the time, temperature and windspeed for Co. Clare. 
A contact form (utilising EmailJS) is also present. Users can enter their name, email address and query. The form then resets 
once ‘Submit’ is pressed. A success pop-up message is displayed. Messages are successfully sent to the related mailbox.

#### **Structure Plane**
Structurally, the website is light and uniform. It is easily navigated by either scrolling or by clicking on the navigation links. 
Navigation buttons and toggle work as expected, links also bring the user to the expected point on the page.  
The carousel is the only full-width feature on the desktop website, with the remaining content structured within a white 
background. On mobile, items appear vertically stacked. 

#### **Skeleton Plane**
Balsamiq wireframes were used to plan the layout of the website on both on desktop and mobile. The same features appear in both 
views, however the buttons x 3 linked to the URL lists change from text to font awesome icons on mobile. The overall layout 
works well as a single scrolling page, as some sections are not very content heavy and would not look as relevant as single html 
pages. 

#### **Surface Plane**
The colour palette was drawn mostly from the images used in the carousel, grey, beige, green and white. The pops of pink provided 
by the flowers are the only use of bright colour on the site. This evokes the bright, stark feel of the Burren, but also the 
serenity and pleasantness of the area. The layout of the website is minimal but informative. The menu and footer icons are 
minimalistic to reduce intrusiveness. The images and map are the main focus of the site.

### **Design**

#### **Wireframes**

The site layout (desktop/mobile) was planned using Balsamiq (www.balsamiq.com). See below. Full size images are available [here] 

_Full Desktop View_<br>
![alt Wireframe Desktop](assets/images/wireframes/balsamiq-desktop-view.PNG)

_Mobile Views_<br>
![alt Wireframe Mobile](assets/images/wireframes/balsamiq-mobile-view.PNG)


#### **Color Palette**

Coolers website (www.coolors.com) was used to compile the colour palette, which reflects the sky, earth, stone, sparse grass and 
petals shown in the images. Greys and beiges are popular colours in todays media, fashion and interiors, giving the site an up-to-date feel.

The main colours used from the palette are 'India Green' #138808, and 'Ecru' #C2B280. The other colours are reflected in the images and 
backgrounds.

![alt Burren Colour Palette](assets/images/layout/coolors-palette.png "Burren Colour Palette")

#### **Images** 
The images on the site were provided by Pexels (www.pexels.com), Unsplash (www.unsplash.com) and me (2 images). Further details are provided 
in the Credits & Acknowledgements section below. 
The images are clear and unskewed, and do not clash with each other visually. They follow the theme of the site and suit the colour palette.

#### **Typography** 
The fonts used on the website were sourced from [Google Fonts](www.fonts.google.com). The font-families are 'Fredericka the Great' (cursive) 
and 'Open Sans' (sans-serif). 
The site brand, carousel caption, image headings, section headings and buttons used the 'Fredericka the Great' font, which does not feel over-used 
despite the number of placements. 'Open Sans' font was used for the navigation links, text list and general text. 

#### **Current Features** 
- The navigation menu is presented as a discreet row at the top of the page, switching to a minimalistic toggle button and list on mobile view.
- The carousel slides provide an informative visual on what to expect from the area the website is about, and the user can choose the speed of 
the slides by clicking on the next/previous arrows.
- The fade in JavaScript effect on the three images above the 'Things to Do' text provide a welcome animation to the site and draw the user's eye 
down to read the text.
- The main information section of the site is the map and accompanying buttons/list/links, which are easy to use and view, and informative.
- The weather widget is a regularly updating feature that users may find helpful when visiting the area
- The working form allows the user to email the site owner and to receive feedback that their message was sent 
- The footer contains social media icons that link to a new tab for the relevant platform

#### **Future Features**
- Seasonal information/brochure style detail could be added in future
- Scroll back to top button could be added to bring the user back to the navigation menu
- Social media accounts that relate to the site could be added

#### **Browser Compatability**
The site was tested with Chrome, Safari and Microsoft Edge. Compatible with each browser.

#### **Device Compatability**
The site was tested on a variety of virtual phones and tablets (via the browser inspect element), and also on a real-world Lenovo ThinkPad laptop, 
an iPhone X and a Huawei Media Pad T5. Responsiveness and accessiblity was positive for each.

#### **Validation**
**HTML** The HTML code was validated at https://validator.w3.org/. See ![alt HTML Passed](assets/images/validated/html-valid.png).
**CSS** The CSS code was validated at https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/. See ![alt CSS Passed](assets/images/validated/css-valid.png).
**JS** The JS code was validated at https://jshint.com/. See ![alt JS Passed with warnings 1](assets/images/validated/jshint1.png), ![alt JS passed with warnings 2](assets/images/validated/jshint2.png) and ![alt JS passed with warnings 3](assets/images/validated/jshint3.png).

Note that the HTML file code passes in the validator, however when the external weather widget is added, errors relating directly to this widgets iframe code are present. See [here](assets/images/validated/html-widget-errors.png).

### **Deployment** <a name="deployment"></a>

#### **Website Creation in Notepad++** <a name="websitecreation"></a>
The website framework was built offline in Notepad++ and copied to GitPod at various milestones.

#### **Website Build in GitHub and GitPod** <a name="websitebuild"></a>

In GitHub, I logged in and clicked on the ‘New’ button in the left-hand menu. On the ‘Create a New Repository’ page, I clicked on the ‘Repository Template’ button and chose the ‘Code Institute’ template provided.
I checked the ‘Include all branches’ tick-box. I entered ‘MilestoneProject-1’ in the ‘Repository Name’ field, left the radio button checked at ‘Public’, and clicked on the ‘Create Repository’ button. 

Once in the new repository, I clicked on ‘GitPod’ in my browser extensions to open the workspace. The ‘index.html’ and ‘style.css’ files were created, with the CSS file being added to the ‘assets/css’ folder.
Much of the code was initially created in Notepad++ then copied to GitPod. Site was updated using GitPod. Images were added to the ‘assets/images’ folder. 
The following command was entered in the terminal to open port 8000 to view the html file in the browser: ‘python3 -m http.server’. 

Commands were also used to add files, commit changes with comments, push to the repository: git add, git commit and git push. 
The status was checked using ‘git status’.

#### **Viewing the Live Website with GitHub Pages** <a name="viewinglive"></a>

In the MilestoneProject-1 repository on GitHub, I clicked on the ‘Settings’ tab and scrolled down to the
GitHub Pages section. I chose ‘Master Branch’ and ‘Save’, then I clicked on the link to successfully view
the live page. This link was also used for responsivity and validation checks.

#### **Text Content** <a name="textcontent"></a>
The 'About The Burren' and 'Climate and Weather' text was taken from the [Burren Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Burren#:~:text=The%20Burren%20(%2F%CB%88b%CA%8C,(or%20sometimes%20glaciokarst)%20landscape.).
The remaining text on the site was written by me.
